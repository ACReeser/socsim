Time to work on your Xenosociology project!

1. Decide what kind of Utopia you want to give the Earthlings.

1. Replace the village leader with a friendly replicabot.

# Utopia
1. Provide your subjects with rules for social interaction: 
  * Economic systems to distribute necessities
  * Government systems to enhance the general welfare
  * Justice systems to punish naughty subjects.
2. Some subjects may not embrace their new Utopia, so expect to crush some light resistance.
1. Research new and exciting ideas to refine your Utopia.

# Lab
1. Observe the earthlings as they wander about their petri dish.
1. Mold your subject's mushy minds into better citizens.
1. Disappear subjects who go mad after learning their true fate.

# Goals
1. Maintain high earthling happiness to receive good Utopia scores
1. Implement utopian policies without upsetting the earthlings
