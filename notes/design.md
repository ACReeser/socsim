Give the earthlings the paradise they deserve.
```

# Alien

Time to farm some Xenosensations from the pathetic Humans!

1. Create a small village on a petri-planet
1. Beam in a bunch of puny Human subjects
1. Harvest the hedons!

# Utopia
1. Provide your subjects with rules for social interaction: 
  * Economic systems to distribute necessities
  * Government systems to enhance the general welfare
  * Justice systems to punish naughty subjects.
1. Some subjects may not embrace their new Utopia, so expect to crush some light resistance.
1. Combine human ideas to refine your Utopia

# Lab
1. Observe the earthlings as they wander about their petri dish.
1. Mold your subject's mushy minds however you please
1. Abduct subjects who just aren't meant for the utopia/dystopia

# Goals
1. Maintain high earthling happiness to receive good Utopia scores
1. Implement utopian policies without upsetting the earthlings
1. Suppress, isolate, or disappear earthlings who fight your utopian goals or go mad after learning the truth

# Actions
* Scan the innermost beliefs of each earthling
* Brainwash your subjects into supporting utopian ideas
* Change the rules of society
* Abduct earthlings for sociological research and psionic harvest
* Disintegrate troublesome earthlings and observe the consequences
* Create new structures for the petri dish ??
* Create new replicabots ?

# Interface

## Petri Dish
> Your subject's tiny world
* perfect circle floating in space
* lightly forested grassland ringed with mountains
* subjects work, wander, and converse on its surface

## Subject Meetings
* Subjects randomly meet with each other
* Conversations:
  * Random chance for belief change? (influence)
  * Chance to gain/lose happiness  (Antagonism, Enthusiasm)
  * Gain/lose sanity
* Crime
  * Murder (die) by mad or bad subjects
  * Assault (-health) by mad or bad subjects
  * Robbery (-cash) by bad subjects


## Area of Effect
* Mad or unhappy subjects can rave, spreading insanity or unhappiness
* Disintegrating subjects spreads severe insanity nearby
* Agitating subjects can incite mobs?

## Public vs private economics

* Buildings can be public and distribute profits to workers
* Buildings can be private and distribute profits to owner

## Goods vs Housing

* Subjects work to create goods
* Subjects require housing
  * housing can be public and support more subjects with less comfort
    * independence debuff
  * housing can be private and support fewer subjects with more comfort
    * collectivism debuff


# Thoughtcrime and Beliefs

subjects have a set of beliefs.
* subjects spend time thinking about their beliefs
* subjects try to convince others of their beliefs
* subject's actions are shaped by their beliefs
* subjects beliefs can be brainwashed

the petri dish will automatically 🚨 alert when subjects think about or talk about things that violate the foundational beliefs of the utopia

```
🚨Thoughtcrime!🚨 *Joe Shmoe* is thinking about *Theocracy*
🚨Speechcrime!🚨 *Joe Shmoe* is talking about *Anarchy*
```

beliefs names must fit "Joe is talking about X" and "Joe believes in X" and "Joe likes X"
